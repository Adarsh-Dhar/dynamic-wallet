# Password Dialog Fix for Medium Risk Transactions

## Problem
When a medium risk transaction was attempted, the system was showing the error message:
```
Password verification required for medium risk transactions
```
Instead of showing the password dialog for user verification.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the approval services (`medium.ts`, `high.ts`, `very-high.ts`) where they were throwing errors when password/passkey verification was required, instead of returning a response indicating that verification was needed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Medium Risk Approval Service (`lib/approval/medium.ts`)
- **Before**: Threw error when password verification was required
- **After**: Returns response indicating password verification status without throwing error
- **Added**: `updateTransactionTracking()` method to track transactions after successful verification

### 2. Fixed High Risk Approval Service (`lib/approval/high.ts`)
- **Before**: Threw error when passkey verification was required  
- **After**: Returns response indicating passkey verification status without throwing error
- **Added**: `updateTransactionTracking()` method to track transactions after successful verification

### 3. Fixed Very-High Risk Approval Service (`lib/approval/very-high.ts`)
- **Before**: Threw error when passkey/OTP verification was required
- **After**: Returns response indicating verification status without throwing error
- **Added**: `updateTransactionTracking()` method to track transactions after successful verification

### 4. Updated SendModal Component (`components/send-modal.tsx`)
- **Added**: Imports for all approval services
- **Updated**: `handlePasswordVerified()` to update transaction tracking for medium risk transactions
- **Updated**: `handlePasskeyVerification()` to update transaction tracking for high risk transactions  
- **Updated**: `handleOtpSubmit()` to update transaction tracking for very-high risk transactions

## Flow After Fix

### Medium Risk Transaction ($1-$3 USDC)
1. User initiates transaction
2. System determines it's medium risk
3. **Password dialog appears** (instead of error)
4. User enters password
5. Password is verified via API
6. If successful: Transaction proceeds and tracking is updated
7. If failed: Transaction is blocked

### High Risk Transaction ($3-$5 USDC)
1. User initiates transaction
2. System determines it's high risk
3. **Passkey dialog appears** (instead of error)
4. User completes passkey verification
5. If successful: Transaction proceeds and tracking is updated
6. If failed: Transaction is blocked

### Very-High Risk Transaction ($5-$7 USDC)
1. User initiates transaction
2. System determines it's very-high risk
3. **Passkey dialog appears** (instead of error)
4. User completes passkey verification
5. **OTP dialog appears** (instead of error)
6. User enters OTP code
7. If successful: Transaction proceeds and tracking is updated
8. If failed: Transaction is blocked

## Key Benefits
- ✅ Password dialog now appears correctly for medium risk transactions
- ✅ No more error messages blocking the flow
- ✅ Proper transaction tracking after successful verification
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all risk levels
- ✅ Better user experience with clear verification steps

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Navigate to a wallet's actions page
2. Try to send USDC with an amount between $1-$3 (medium risk)
3. The password dialog should appear instead of an error
4. Enter a password and verify the transaction proceeds
